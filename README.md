<h2>Tree Terminologies</h2>
<ul>
 <li><b>Tree</b> - A tree is a dynamic data structure consisting of a node element, containing
indication of a finite number of disjoint nodes constituting subtrees of a given node.</li>
 
 <li><b>Root</b> - The initial node (the highest one)</li>
 <li><b>Leaf</b> - An element that has no children (pointers to others nodes)</li>
 <li><b>Node</b> - An element that is not a leaf or a root </li>
 <li><b>Depth of a Node</b> - The root of the tree is at level 0 and each child node is at level one higher.</li>
</ul>
