# Tree data structure
 Defining, using structures, formulating binary search tree (BST) and AVL algorithms with implementation in C++.
<h2>Tree Terminologies</h2>
<ul>
 <li><b>Tree</b> - A tree is a dynamic data structure consisting of a node element, containing
indication of a finite number of disjoint nodes constituting subtrees of a given node.</li>
 
 <li><b>Root</b> - The initial node (the highest one)</li>
 <li><b>Leaf</b> - An element that has no children (pointers to others nodes)</li>
 <li><b>Node</b> - An element that is not a leaf or a root </li>
 <li><b>Depth of a Node</b> - The root of the tree is at level 0 and each child node is at level one higher.</li>
 <li><b>Degree of a node</b> - The number of direct descendants of the node.</li>
 <li><b>Degree of a tree</b> - Maximum degree of all nodes. Degree zero nodes have no children and are called leaves.</li>
 <li><b>Height of a node</b> - The number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the node to a leaf node).</li>
 <li><b>Height of a tree</b> - Maximum height of all nodes. The longest path starting from the root node.</li>
